# Bowling-Game

Bowling Game for a Job Technical Interview

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete the exercise with the criteria you were looking for, and the project is not functional at the moment. However, it was a valuable exercise that made me think a lot, especially since I wasn't familiar with how bowling scores are calculated. It's always good to encounter fun challenges.

There are several areas for improvement in this project, with the main ones being:

- Completing the game loop, which was my primary focus. This part took more time than I would have liked for development.

- Finalizing the scoring logic, which was the main objective of the exercise.

- Enhancing the player's camera to make it more dynamic with different shot perspectives.

- Improving the graphics, both in 3D and 2D.

- Adding sound effects.

- Enhancing the overall feel and experience of the game.

Even though I couldn't complete the project, Iâ€™m sharing a UML diagram that illustrates my approach to tackling this project.
